LendingLibrary
==============

A Lending Library Built in Meteor, for keeping track of your stuff.

This is the final code sample from my book <a href="http://link.packtpub.com/kDEOeS"> Getting Started with Meteor.js JavaScript Framework</a>

The code itself (not the book) is <a href="LendingLibrary/blob/master/MIT-License.txt">MIT licensed</a>. 

Thanks, and I hope you enjoy it!
